# Data Science Portfolio

Curated index of selected applied data science projects across **recommenders**, **classical ML**, **time series**, and **visual analytics**.  
Each repo is self-contained with a clean README, notebooks/reports, and runnable code where applicable.

> If you only have time for three: **Sequence Size & Fit Recommender**, **Fraud Detection (Imbalanced)**, **Music RecSys (R Shiny)**.
