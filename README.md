# Data Science Portfolio

Short, curated index of my applied data science projects across **recommenders, classical ML, time series, and visualization**. Each repo is self-contained with a clean README, notebooks/reports, and runnable code where applicable.

> If you only have time for three: **Size & Fit Recommender**, **Fraud Detection (Imbalanced)**, **Music RecSys (R Shiny)**.
